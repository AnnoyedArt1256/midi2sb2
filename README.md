# midi2sb2
Converts MIDI to a Scratch 2.0 Project<br>
Based off Chooper100's MIDI converter<a href="https://github.com/chooper100/MIDI-Importer"> here</a>
## Prerequisites

You will need to have the Microsoft.Net Framework v4.0
installed on your computer in order to run the program.

You can obtain a copy here:
https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=17851

## Running for the first time

On Windows 8 and above, the first time you run the
program you may see the Windows SmartScreen filter pop
up, blocking the application.

If this happens, you need to click on 'More info' and
select 'Run anyway'

## Using the program

Click load and find the .mid file you want to import
into Scratch.

The program automaticly selects the most apropriate voice
for the instrument. However, if it can't pick the best
track, it will not have an instrument assigned to it.
Use the dropdown menu to select the best instrument.
You can also mute tracks by clicking on the 'mute' checkbox.

Some drums are actually MIDI instruments, which the importer
cannot play. In this case, select any voice then mute the
track.

## Converting

When you're done, the program will output an SB2 file with
the MIDI contained.
